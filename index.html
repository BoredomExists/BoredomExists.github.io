                <p>These are the first drafts of the new Parking app for the University of South Carolina, that helps students and faculty find parking on campus. 
                  The app works by tracking the number of available spots in each parking lot on campus and tells the user which lots still have availability nearby.</p>

                <p>This is how the app is going to look like when it is made. The app will start with a login that requires a USC account or the user can be a guest. The user would then be greeted with the home screen where the user can has an option to search for nearby parking garages and lots. 
                  The app then displays a map that shows nearby lots and parking lots and the user can select from the list to see if any spots are available. 
                  Once, the user selects the lot they want to go to. The app will then guide them to the lot. 
                  Once the user arrives, the user will be sent back to the home screen and there is a recent button that shows them the recent lots they have been to.</p>
